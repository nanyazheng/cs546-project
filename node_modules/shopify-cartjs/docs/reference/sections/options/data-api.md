*Boolean (default: `true`)*

When `true`, Cart.js will automatically bind `document` listeners for events related to element you've marked up with `data-cart-` attributes.

If you're not making use of the Data API and are super-concerned with performance, you can set this to `false`, but in reality you'll probably never need to adjust this.
