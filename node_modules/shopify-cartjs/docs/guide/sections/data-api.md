The Data API is the easiest way to start using Cart.js, and for a lot of use cases it'll be all you need.

All you need to do is add the appropriate `data-` attributes to your code, and the event listeners automatically set up by Cart.js will do the rest.

This guide provides a quick overview - for a full list of available markup attributes, check out the [Data API Reference][].
